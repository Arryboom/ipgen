	* Removed $Id$ keywords from all files, and associated rcsid variables
	  from C source. These are not really needed and they don't work with
	  git.

	* .gitignore: new file containing file patterns that should not be
	  committed to the repository.

	* .travis.yml: new file to enable automatic building on Travis CI
